# Led control

Raspberry Pico controls a LED band using Circuit Python. All the instructions are received from a REACT.js app through http requests.

Currently, the app is capable of sending color codes, to set the leds to that color.

#TODO:

- Add a way of turning on and off the lights
- Add more functionality
- Polish the front end
